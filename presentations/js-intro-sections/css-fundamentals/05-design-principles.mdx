## Overview: CSS Design Principles

Before styling the habit card, plan your design approach:

- Layout Strategy:
    - Choose between Flexbox (1D layout) vs Grid (2D layout)
    - Consider content hierarchy and information flow
    - Plan for responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Visual Hierarchy:
    - Use typography scale (headings, body text, captions)
    - Color coding for categories and status indicators
    - Visual weight through size, color, and spacing
