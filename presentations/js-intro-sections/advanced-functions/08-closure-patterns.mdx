## Understanding Closure Patterns for State Management

Closures enable powerful patterns for managing private state:

**Factory Function Pattern:**
```javascript
function createCounter(start = 0) {
  let count = start; // Private variable
  
  return {
    increment: () => ++count,
    decrement: () => --count,
    getValue: () => count
  };
}
```

- Benefits of Closure-Based Objects:
- Data privacy (no external access to internal variables)
  - Multiple instances with independent state
  - Clean, controlled interfaces
  - No need for classes or `this` keyword complications

**For the exercise**: Create a goal tracker factory that manages progress privately while providing public methods for interaction.
