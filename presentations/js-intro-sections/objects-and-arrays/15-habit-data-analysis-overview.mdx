## Exercise Overview: Habit Data Analysis

You'll work with an array of daily habit records to:

1. - Filter completed days** to get success rate
2. **Calculate total points** across all days
3. **Find completion percentage** for progress tracking
4. **Extract specific data** like just the dates

**Array Concepts You'll Apply:
- `filter()` to find matching records
  - `reduce()` to calculate totals
  - `map()` to extract specific values
  - Method chaining for complex operations

**Goal**: Transform raw daily data into meaningful insights
