## Array Method Patterns for Data Analysis

Common patterns for processing array data

## Filtering and Counting

```javascript
const completedDays = records.filter(day => day.completed);
const totalCompleted = completedDays.length;
```

Use `filter()` to select matching items, then count with `.length`

## Mapping for Transformation

```javascript
const pointsOnly = records.map(day => day.points);
const dailyNames = records.map(day => day.date);
```

Use `map()` to extract specific properties from objects

## Reducing for Totals

```javascript
const totalPoints = records.reduce((sum, day) => {
  return day.completed ? sum + day.points : sum;
}, 0);
```

Use `reduce()` to combine all values into a single result

## Chaining Methods

```javascript
const completedDates = records
  .filter(day => day.completed)
  .map(day => day.date);
```

Combine multiple methods for complex transformations
