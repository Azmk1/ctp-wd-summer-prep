## Processing Pipeline Example

```javascript
const dailyHabits = [
  { name: 'Exercise', completed: true, points: 10 },
  { name: 'Reading', completed: false, points: 5 },
  { name: 'Meditation', completed: true, points: 8 },
  { name: 'Water', completed: true, points: 3 }
];

// Process: filter completed → extract points → sum total
const totalPoints = dailyHabits
  .filter(habit => habit.completed)     // [Exercise, Meditation, Water]
  .map(habit => habit.points)           // [10, 8, 3]
  .reduce((sum, points) => sum + points, 0); // 21

console.log(`Today's points: ${totalPoints}`);
```

## Key Processing Insight

Chain methods to create powerful data processing pipelines

- Each method transforms the data
- Results flow from one method to the next
- Final result is clean and readable
