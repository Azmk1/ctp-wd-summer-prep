    ## Why Asynchronous?
        
    - JavaScript is single-threaded
    - Can't block while waiting for slow operations
    - Network requests, file I/O, timers need async
    - Enables responsive user interfaces
    - Real-world analogy:
      - Restaurant kitchen - take orders while cooking
      - Don't wait for one meal before starting next
