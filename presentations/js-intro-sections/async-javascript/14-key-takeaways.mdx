## Key Takeaways: Asynchronous JavaScript

- Remember:
- JavaScript is single-threaded but non-blocking
  - Callbacks → Promises → Async/Await (evolution)
  - Always handle errors in async code
  - Use Promise.all() for parallel operations
  - Async/await makes code more readable

- Common Pitfalls:
- Forgetting to await async functions
  - Not handling promise rejections
  - Creating sequential code when parallel would work
