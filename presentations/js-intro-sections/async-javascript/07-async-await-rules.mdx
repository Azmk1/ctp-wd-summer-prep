## Async/Await Rules

**Key concepts to remember:- 

**The `async` keyword:
- Makes a function return a Promise automatically
  - Allows use of `await` inside the function

- The `await` keyword:
- Can only be used inside `async` functions
  - Pauses execution until the Promise resolves
  - Returns the resolved value (not the Promise)

- Error handling:
- Use `try/catch` blocks with async/await
  - Much cleaner than `.catch()` chains

**Real benefit:** Write asynchronous code that reads like synchronous code!
