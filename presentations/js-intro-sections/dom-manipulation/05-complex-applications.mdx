## Understanding Complex DOM Applications

Building a full interactive application requires:

- HTML Structure Planning:
- Semantic HTML with proper IDs and classes
  - Form elements for user input
  - Container areas for dynamic content

- JavaScript Architecture:
- State management (tracking data in variables)
  - Event handling for user interactions
  - Dynamic content creation and updates
  - Data persistence (localStorage)

**Progressive Enhancement Strategy:**
1. Start with basic form handling
2. Add dynamic content creation
3. Implement interactivity features
4. Add styling and animations

**For this exercise**: Build a complete habit tracker with adding, completing, and managing habits.
