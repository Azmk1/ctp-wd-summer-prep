## Key Takeaways: DOM Manipulation

- Remember:
- The DOM is your bridge between JavaScript and HTML
  - Select elements before you can modify them
  - Event listeners make pages interactive
  - Create dynamic content with createElement()
  - Always consider performance with DOM operations

- Modern Alternatives:
- React, Vue, Angular abstract DOM manipulation
  - Virtual DOM for better performance
  - But understanding vanilla DOM is essential!

*Master the DOM, and you can build any web interface!*
