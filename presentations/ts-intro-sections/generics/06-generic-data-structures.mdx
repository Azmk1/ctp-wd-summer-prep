## Building Generic Data Structures

Real applications need flexible storage systems:

- Generic Storage Requirements:
- Store items of any type safely
  - Provide CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Maintain type safety throughout operations
  - Allow searching and filtering

**Generic Constraints for Practical Use:**
```typescript
// Constraint: items must have an 'id' property
interface Identifiable {
  id: string;
}

class Storage<T extends Identifiable> {
  private items: T[] = [];
  
  add(item: T): void { /* ... */ }
  getById(id: string): T | undefined { /* ... */ }
}
```

**The Challenge**: Build a storage system that works with any object type while ensuring they have the properties needed for storage operations.
