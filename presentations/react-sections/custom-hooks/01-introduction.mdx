## What are Custom Hooks?

### Custom Hooks are:
- **JavaScript functions** that use React Hooks
- **Start with "use"** by convention
- **Share stateful logic** between components
- **Don't share state itself** - each call gets its own state
- **Can use other hooks** including other custom hooks

### Why Custom Hooks?
- **Reusability** - Share logic across components
- **Separation of concerns** - Keep components clean
- **Testability** - Test logic in isolation
- **Composition** - Build complex hooks from simple ones
