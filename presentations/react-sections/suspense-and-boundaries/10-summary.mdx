## Summary

### Key Concepts:
- **Suspense** handles async loading declaratively
- **Error boundaries** catch and handle errors
- **Lazy loading** splits code for performance
- **Resource pattern** for data fetching
- **Strategic placement** of boundaries

### Use Cases:
- Code splitting with lazy()
- Route-based code splitting
- Progressive loading of UI
- Data fetching (experimental)
- Error recovery flows

### Remember:
- Always **handle both loading and error** states
- Error boundaries **only catch errors in render**
- Suspense is **declarative** - let React handle timing
- **Test both success and failure** paths
