## Why Test React Components?

### Benefits:
- **Catch bugs early** before they reach production
- **Document behavior** through test cases
- **Refactor confidently** with safety net
- **Prevent regressions** when adding features
- **Improve design** by thinking about usage

### What to Test:
- **User interactions** (clicks, typing, etc.)
- **Component output** based on props/state
- **Side effects** (API calls, timers)
- **Edge cases** and error states
- **Accessibility** features
