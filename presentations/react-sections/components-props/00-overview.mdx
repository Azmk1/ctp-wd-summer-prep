## What are Components?

### Components are:
- **Building blocks** of React applications
- **Reusable** pieces of UI
- **Independent** and isolated
- **Composable** - can contain other components
- **Accept inputs** called props
- **Return JSX** to describe UI

### In our habit tracker:
- HabitCard, HabitList, ProgressBar, Calendar components
- Each component handles one specific aspect of the UI
