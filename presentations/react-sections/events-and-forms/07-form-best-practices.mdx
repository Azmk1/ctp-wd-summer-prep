## Form Best Practices

### 1. **Always Use Controlled Components**
- Easier to validate
- Single source of truth
- Better integration with React

### 2. **Validate on Multiple Events**
- On blur for immediate feedback
- On change for real-time validation
- On submit for final validation

### 3. **Provide Clear Error Messages**
- Be specific about what's wrong
- Show errors near the relevant field
- Use proper ARIA attributes for accessibility

### 4. **Handle Loading States**
- Disable form during submission
- Show loading indicators
- Prevent double submissions

### 5. **Consider Form Libraries**
- React Hook Form
- Formik
- React Final Form
