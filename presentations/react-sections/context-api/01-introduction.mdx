## The Prop Drilling Problem

### What is Prop Drilling?
- Passing props through multiple component levels
- Components receive props just to pass them down
- Makes refactoring difficult
- Creates unnecessary dependencies
- Harder to maintain as app grows

### When Context Helps:
- **Theme data** - Colors, fonts, dark mode
- **User authentication** - Current user, permissions
- **Language/locale** - i18n settings
- **App configuration** - Feature flags, API endpoints
- **UI state** - Modals, notifications, sidebars
