## What is State?

### State is:
- **Component memory** that persists between renders
- **Dynamic data** that changes over time
- **Local** to each component instance
- **Triggers re-renders** when updated
- **Managed with hooks** in function components

### Props vs State:
- **Props**: External, read-only, passed from parent
- **State**: Internal, mutable, managed by component
