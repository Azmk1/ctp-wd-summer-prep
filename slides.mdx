  ## What is TypeScript
  - TypeScript is an extension of the JavaScript language
  - It adds annotations that describe what "type" we expect values to be
  - The TypeScript compiler checks these annotations and ensures they match
  - It also removes them during compilation to output pure JavaScript

## What's a Type?

- Types are shapes: a set of properties and methods we expect values to implement
- Strings, Numbers, Objects...even `undefined` and `null` values all have corresponding types
- In JavaScript, references to values in variables, arguments, and return types can be anything
- TypeScript has the `any` type, which describes JavaScripts built in type system (i.e. none)
- TypeScript defines what shapes each value should be, and checks that we keep that contract

## TypeScript is a Cool Toy

## JavaScript's Type Problem

<FlexBox alignItems="center" justifyContent="center" flexDirection="column">

What's wrong with this picture?

```typescript
function calculateDiscount(price, discount) {
  return price - (price * discount);
}

console.log(calculateDiscount(100, 0.2));
console.log(calculateDiscount(100, "20%")); // Oops!
```
</FlexBox>
</SlideLayout.Center>

## The Price is `NaN`, Bob

<FlexBox alignItems="center" justifyContent="center">

and just like on TV, we wouldn't bet told until after the fact

## TypeScript can predict the future

- On the other hand, TypeScript can tell us about this mistake beforehand
- If we say its a number, TypeScript will complain if we try to give a string
- These bugs happen all the time in JavaScript, as we pass values around
</SlideLayout.Center>

<SlideLayout.Center>
## With TypeScript...

```typescript
function calculateDiscount(price: number, discount: number): number {
  return price - (price * discount);
}

console.log(calculateDiscount(100, 0.2));
console.log(calculateDiscount(100, "20%"));
```

## A Silver Bullet in a Foot Gun

- TypeScript guarantees the values ***you assign*** will be of the expected type
- However, values ***you don't assign***, like those that come from API's and users may be incorrect
- Understanding this loophole is important to knowing where to validate, or check data

## The Type Layer
- TypeScript is really two languages in one file
- There's JavaScript, this describes what does happen at runtime
- There's TypeScript, this annotates the JavaScript, describes what should happen at runtime
</SlideLayout.Center>

## The Power of Intellisense

- Even before we compile the code, well before we run it, TypeScript tells us there may be a problem
- As you're typing `'20%'`, VSCode will check the types in real time, and give you the error inline
- TypeScript gives your editor additional super-powers, like:
  - Finding all references to a value
  - Seeing what properties an object has
  - Renaming a property across the entire codebase
- All of which are very tough for humans to do, and error prone, in JavaScript
